0x041e -- Decentralised Preprint
================================

Contribution
------------
Individual papers should be submitted as `./docs/pre/SHA256(author_last+year).html`, following `template.html`.

Javascript
----------
Almost all hyperlinks are local (excluding contribution, and reporting). Javascript is used to search the `pre/` directory, but can be easily done on a local copy. With the noted exclusions, 0x041e will work perfectly fine on a local copy.

Licensing
---------
The source code for '0x041e.org' is licensed under the terms of GPL v3+. Authors of indexed works reserve all rights to their work. Uploaders are responsible for their submitted content; 0x041e makes no claim of ownership on submitted content.
